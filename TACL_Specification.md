## TACL Specification
Revision: 0.2.0 - DRAFT

Sections need to be written using the original specification and the examples. 

1. **Introduction**
   - Purpose of the language.
   - Design goals and philosophy.
   - Scope and limitations.
   - Intended audience and use cases.

2. **Lexical Structure**
   - Character set (e.g., ASCII, Unicode).
   - Lexical elements (tokens) such as keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and separators.
   - Comments and white space treatment.

3. **Syntax**
   - Grammar definitions (using BNF, EBNF, or other suitable notation).
   - Description of syntactic constructs (statements, expressions, blocks, etc.).
   - Precedence and associativity of operators.

4. **Types and Variables**
   - Data types supported (primitives, composites, user-defined).
   - Variable declaration and scope rules.
   - Type casting and conversion rules.

5. **Expressions and Operators**
   - Arithmetic, logical, relational, and bitwise operators.
   - Evaluation rules for expressions.

6. **Control Flow**
   - Conditionals (if-then-else, switch-case).
   - Loops (for, while, do-while).
   - Exception handling (if applicable).
   - Subroutines (procedures, functions, methods).

7. **Procedures and Functions**
   - Declaration and invocation.
   - Parameter passing mechanisms (by value, by reference).
   - Return values.

8. **Data Structures and Abstractions**
   - Arrays, records, lists, and other built-in structures.
   - Definition and use of classes, modules, or namespaces (if applicable).
   - Inheritance and polymorphism (if object-oriented).

9. **Concurrency and Parallelism**
   - Concepts of concurrency in the language (if applicable).
   - Mechanisms for managing concurrent processes or threads.

10. **Input/Output**
    - I/O primitives and file handling.

11. **Error Handling**
    - Runtime errors and exceptions.
    - Error reporting and recovery strategies.

12. **Standard Library (if applicable)**
    - Overview of included libraries and modules.
    - Description of key library functions and their usage.

13. **Interoperability**
    - Interaction with other languages or systems.
    - Foreign function interfaces.

14. **Execution Model**
    - Description of the runtime environment.
    - Compilation or interpretation process.

15. **Examples**
    - Sample code illustrating typical usage.
    - Explanation of each example for clarity.

16. **Appendices**
    - Glossary of terms.
    - Comparison with similar languages.
    - Revision history.

17. **References**
    - Citations for any external resources, academic papers, or existing standards that influenced the design.

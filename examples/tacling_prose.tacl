# "In the beginning, there was a vision, an aspiration for unity and justice, 
#    as articulated by the Preamble. From its profound prose, the very essence 
#    of governance was conjured—a Constitution for the United States of America. 
#    The Preamble's words echoed the principles of democracy and the rule of law, 
#    and from this ethereal declaration, the structure of a new government began 
#    to take form."

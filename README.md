# TACL
Thing-Action-Context Language (TACL) is a language that centers around the concept of "Things" which encapsulate data, actions, and control structures. TACL emphasizes readability and simplicity, using unique syntax that mirrors natural language while maintaining computational precision. It is a formulaic way to explain how to do anything.
